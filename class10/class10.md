> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The `winpercent` variable looks to be on a different scale to the
majority of the other columns in the dataset. `Winpercent` measures as a
percent out of 100.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

A zero means that the candy does not contain chocolate and one means
that the candy does contain chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](class10_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

The distribution of winpercent values are not symmetrical.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%, it’s from 35-45%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
```

    [1] 60.92153

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```

    [1] 44.11974

On average chocolate is ranked higher than fruit candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)],candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] and candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     11.44563 22.15795
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     60.92153  44.11974 

This difference is statistically significant because the p-value is
2.871e-08.

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the
> positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

The original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive
direction are fruity, hard, and pluribus. This makes sense because most
fruity candy are hard and come in a bag or box of multiple candies.
These 3 variables tend to be correlated.
